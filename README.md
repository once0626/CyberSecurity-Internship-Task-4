# Task 4: Password Security & Authentication Analysis

## Objective
To understand how passwords are stored, how weak passwords are attacked, and why strong authentication mechanisms like MFA are important.

## Concepts Covered
- Hashing vs Encryption
- Common hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, bcrypt)
- Password cracking techniques
- Dictionary attack vs Brute force attack
- Importance of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

## Analysis Summary
Weak passwords can be easily cracked using dictionary or brute force attacks, especially when outdated hash algorithms are used. Modern systems use slow hashing algorithms and MFA to protect user accounts.

## Outcome
This task improved understanding of password security, attack techniques, and best practices used in real-world systems.
